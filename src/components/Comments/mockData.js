The Temple was then moved, put out in the open in Queen Victoria Street in front of some offices and was largely ignored - essentially just looked like a small ruined wall. I used to see a few tourists come to see it and quickly walk away.<p>Credit to Bloomberg for putting it back in its original position and making seeing it a worthwhile experience.<p>The Bloomberg office is worth a visit too - it won the Stirling Prize for architecture in the UK - but it&#x27;s not open to the general public, although they have hosted some tech talks in there.",

Even in the case of the ceramics, the colour was baked in at firing, so there&#x27;s nothing there (in terms of colours at least) in any of the materials, generally, to degrade. If they got worn, you just got the same colour through the whole of the tessera, so it wouldn&#x27;t show in terms of degradation of the pattern - you&#x27;d just get wear and tear on the materials themselves.",
